The inspiration and large parts of the design of the Elementary framework came from David Gilbertson's vanilla JavaScript React implementation. He's written an excellent blog post about it [here](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff). The code for his project can be found [here](https://github.com/davidgilbertson/know-it-all).

The clever trick for hosting a single-page app with GitHub Pages I owe to Daniel Buchner. Head over to [his article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/sghpa-single-page-app-hack-github-pages/) to see how it's done.
